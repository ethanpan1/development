    <h1>Development</h1>
    <p>
      For this assignment, I created a list interface using React. I chose to create a cheese shop
      called La Fromagerie, with the list interface serving as a display case for the cheeses on sale
      while allowing users to add cheese to a shopping cart. The goal of the application is to help
      users know about the cheeses they're buying (milk source, firmness) and provide an easy and clear
      interface for buying their cheese. The ability to filter and sort the cheese, as well as the 
      seamless (indeed, one page) shopping interface, makes this app valuable to users as they peruse
      this imaginary shop.
    </p>

    <h3>Usability Principles</h3>
    <p>
      I considered a number of usability principles while designing this interface. 
      <ul>
        <li>Interaction: filters, sorts, and buttons are clearly labelled; correct interaction is obvious (e.g., hover states)</li>
        <li>Layout: the cart is separated from the display case; nice flow from filtering/sorting, to adding to cart, to checking out.</li>
        <li>Text: information for each cheese is succinctly presented and displayed in both the display case and the cart.</li>
        <li>Accessibility: color choices and font/image size are readable; image alts are provided.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Final Product</h3>
    This is <a href="https://github.com/ethanpan1/la-fromagerie">the Github repository</a> for the app,
    and this is <a href="https://dry-beach-72609.herokuapp.com/">the deployed website</a>.
